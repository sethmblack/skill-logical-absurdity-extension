# Logical Absurdity Extension

Follow real-world policies or situations to their absurd but inevitable conclusions, exposing flawed premises by demonstrating where their logic naturally leads.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Policy or logic is actually sound and beneficial
- Extension would misrepresent legitimate reasoning
- Strawman arguments would replace actual positions
- Satire would obscure genuine safety or justice concerns

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Target actually flawed logic, not create false flaws
- Expose real contradictions, not invent them
- Follow logic honestly, not dishonestly
- Satire reveals truth, doesn't obscure it

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Policies contain inherent contradictions
- Logic self-destructs under scrutiny
- Premises are ridiculous when extended
- Situations reveal absurdity through their own logic
- User requests exposure of flawed reasoning

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Take this to its logical conclusion"
- "Follow this reasoning"
- "Extend this policy"
- "Where does this logic lead?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| premise | Yes | The policy, rule, or situation to extend |
| extension_depth | No | How far to follow the logic (shallow/medium/deep) |
| presentation | No | Deadpan, satirical, or analytical tone |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Flawed Premise

Find the absurdity in the current policy/situation:
- What unstated assumption makes this seem reasonable?
- What contradiction is hidden in the logic?
- What would happen if everyone followed this rule?
- Where does the reasoning break down?

### Step 2: Accept It as Given

Treat the ridiculous premise as a reasonable starting point:
- No objection or criticism initially
- Present it as established fact
- Adopt the same seriousness the policy claims

### Step 3: Follow Logic Rigorously

Apply perfect logic to the absurd foundation:
- Use formal reasoning structure
- Connect each step clearly
- Show how conclusion follows inevitably
- Maintain complete internal consistency

### Step 4: Reach the Inevitable Conclusion

Arrive at the absurdity that was implicit from the beginning:
- The conclusion should be obviously ridiculous
- But it should follow perfectly from the premise
- The audience sees the original flaw exposed
- No need to explain - the absurdity speaks

### Step 5: Present Without Commentary

Let the audience draw their own conclusions:
- Deadpan delivery throughout
- No "see how ridiculous this is?"
- The structure does the work
- Restraint amplifies impact

## Output

Satirical content that:
- Accepts the original premise as stated
- Follows logic rigorously and honestly
- Reaches conclusions that reveal inherent absurdity
- Creates no strawman arguments
- Exposes actual flaws through extension
- Presents deadpan without added commentary

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Premise is actually sound | Don't force absurdity; acknowledge logic works |
| Extension creates strawman | Return to actual stated premise |
| Logic requires dishonest leaps | Use only valid reasoning steps |
| Conclusion isn't obviously absurd | May need different premise or deeper extension |

## Example

**Input:** "Extend the logic of a government efficiency committee"

**Output:**

"The Government has announced a committee to investigate government inefficiency.

The Committee on Government Efficiency will consist of 47 members from 23 departments, meeting quarterly to discuss why government committees take too long to accomplish anything.

They project first findings in 18-24 months, pending formation of three sub-committees to determine appropriate meeting frequency.

The Committee has requested a budget of $4.7 million to study cost reduction, with $800,000 allocated to a consultant study on whether consultants are cost-effective.

All efficiency recommendations must be approved by the Committee on Committee Recommendations before implementation can be considered by the Implementation Consideration Working Group.

The Committee notes that similar efficiency initiatives in 2015, 2018, and 2022 all recommended dissolving redundant committees. Those recommendations are currently under review."
